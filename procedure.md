### Procedure

#### Visualize and Listen

This section requires selection of the sampling frequency, entering the tone frequency and volume, and visualizing the tone of the specified parameters and also listening to it. **Please make sure to reduce the volume before playing the sounds!**. Click on the "**Listen**" button to visualize the plot, and listen to the tone. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Select the sampling frequency in the drop down provided.
2. Enter the value for tone frequency.
3. Enter the volume for the tone.
3. Click on "**Listen**" button to visualize the plot in the figure and listen to the tone.

Things to try

1. If the sampling frequency is $X$, try listening to tone frequency of $\frac{X}{2}$, and note what you hear.
2. If the sampling frequency is $X$, and tone frequency is $Y$, try listening to tone frequencies $Y$ and $X-Y$, and note what you hear.

#### Envelope

This section requires selection of the envelope, entering the tone frequency and volume, and visualizing the specified envelope and also listening to the tone, masked under that envelope. **Please make sure to reduce the volume before playing the sounds!**. Click on the "**Listen**" button to visualize the plot, and listen to the tone. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Select the envelope (either "**ADSR**", "**Rectangular**" or "**Exponential Decay**") in the drop down provided.
2. Enter the value for tone frequency.
3. Enter the volume for the tone.
3. Click on "**Listen**" button to visualize the plot for the envelope in the figure and listen to the tone masked under that envelope.

#### Harmonics

This section requires selection of the envelope, entering the fundamental frequency, the harmonic numbers and corresponding volumes, and visualizing the note and also listening to it. **Please make sure to reduce the volume before playing the sounds!**. Click on the "**Listen**" button to visualize the plot, and listen to the note. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Select the envelope (either "**ADSR**", "**Rectangular**" or "**Exponential Decay**") in the drop down provided.
2. Enter the value for fundamental frequency.
3. Enter the harmonic numbers to be combined.
3. Enter the corresponding volumes for each harmonic number.
3. Click on "**Listen**" button to visualize the plot for the note in the figure and listen to it.

#### Play

This section requires selection of the envelope, entering the fundamental frequency, the harmonic numbers, corresponding volumes and the duration for the note, and listening to all the notes played one after the other in the specified order for specified durations. **Please make sure to reduce the volume before playing the sounds!**. Click on the "**Add Note**" button to add new fields to enter information in. Click on the "**Remove**" button in green, next to that note to remove that note. Click on the "**Listen**" button to listen to the notes, one after the other. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Click on "**Add Note**" button to add new notes
2. Select the envelope (either "**ADSR**", "**Rectangular**" or "**Exponential Decay**") in the drop down provided.
3. Enter the value for fundamental frequency for each note.
4. Enter the harmonic numbers to be combined for each note.
5. Enter the corresponding volumes for each harmonic number for each note.
6. Enter the duration for each note
6. Click on "**Listen**" button to listen to the notes one after the other.
